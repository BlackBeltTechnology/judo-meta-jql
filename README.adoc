== Introduction

> JQL stands for JUDO Query Language.

It contains the JQL meta model.

JQL is a general purpose query language which lets modelers describe queries which do not need to be manually developed
by developers/engineers. The architecture is responsible for the processing and execution.

It acts as an eclipse plugin with features and sites, can be used standalone and in standard OSGi (without eclipse).
